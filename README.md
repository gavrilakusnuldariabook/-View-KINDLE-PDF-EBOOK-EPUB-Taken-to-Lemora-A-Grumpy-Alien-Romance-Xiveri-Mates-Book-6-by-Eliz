Rating: 3.0 out of 5 stars
Title: I't's good but not amazing
Date: Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2021
Review: While definitely good, this one didn't pack quite the same punch the other books in the series did. I felt like it was focused less on them as a couple and instead more on Raingar learning to not be grumpy and/or jealous.

Essmira was an okay enough heroine so I don't have any complaints about her. I do wish the other characters weren't talking "around" her as if she were incapable of understanding Raingar was her mate as it led to most of the "conflict" in the first 3/4 of the book.

Finally, with no spoilers, the last 1/4 conflict seemed to come out of no where and seemed like it was there more to tie in later books than to actually resolve anything in the current one.

Overall I liked it and I'll read the next one, I just wanted to like this one more than I ended up.

Title: A Descent into PTSD and Back Again
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2021
Review: This book captured the trauma experienced by a female, Essmira, who was stolen from her birthplace and raised by two psychotic beings to be one thing and one thing only, a pleasure female. When rescued and freed from this task, this book entails her journey to discover what she is, bereft of her life's vocation and all that vocation comprised, i.e., absolute deference to males and putting them before herself in looks, thoughts, dress, demeanor, in essence, all actions and her ensuing relationship with the male who secured her safety by arranging for her purchase, Rainier. The reader is meant to contrast Essmira, a husk of a being with Raingar, gruff, unpolished, taciturn, with an unmitigated fear of harming Essmira and devoid of knowledge of / terror at his inability to clearly see how to win her heart.

So what does this mean for the reader? It meant that much of this book was composed of inner monologues: Essmira's extreme self-effacement: Oh-my-goodness-I've-done-something-wrong / a-pleasure-female-never-engages-in... and Raingar,: Woo-her??? How-do-I-woo-her? She has been taken from me for this reason or another reason. I cannot survive her absence. She doesn't want me, when she can choose from any warrior.

What did it mean for this reader? It meant that I had to endure Essmira's becoming an entity unto herself and Raingar's understanding that not everything he did would repel the sentiments of Essmira. In sum, this wasn't a bad book; it just wasn't my type of book.

Lastly, two comments. First, I did not like the principal female's name, Essmira. It was too close to the name of the Eshmiri readers. With all of the possible names in the world, we readers were given two that were almost the same. This is trite, just a matter of personal preference. Second, to end on a more positive note, I would like to commend the writer for her grasp of character development. Both of the principal characters had to go through their respective evolutions to arrive at a state where they could find their HEA together. The author was very adept at taking us through these transitions. They flowed evenly and made sense.

Title: A great quick read
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2021
Review: First thing I would recommend this entire series. It is a standalone so feel free to start with this book, but I recommend going back to the beginning because I do think they are all wonderful and you see the universe that the author is creating develop. This book like the others hits it out of the park with amazing world building and an in depth look at the different cultures that are interacting in these books. Her characters all tend to be real in the sense they actually have to deal with the trauma events in their lives and we see them grow and develop. I like the sense of humor that you see peeking through in this series as well.

As for this story we have Raingar and Essmira‚Äôs story. He is a Lemoran which is a hard-skinned species with huge horns. He is the chieftain of his village and has a personality hat is of a grumpy male but adorable at the same time. He often seems clueless and when meeting his mate this trait causes both humor and conflict.

Essmira is a hybrid equal parts human and Drakesh with no clue of her origins she has been raised by flesh peddlers. Raingar pushes her to not just be what she has been trained to but to find herself. Seeing Essmira's growth in this story is amazing and how the two of them develop their relationship.

Title: Childish Hero
Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2021
Review: So out of all the books in the series I like this one the least. Main!y because the hero isn't grumpy, he's a spoiled child needlessly shouting at everyone and overreacting to everything that happens. I only finished the book to keep up with what happens in the bigger plot...

Review: Ok so I‚Äôve loved all the books in the series so far. But, just no. I‚Äôm so frustrated! Like really!?!?üò≥üò≥üò≥
Uuuggh‚Ä¶ so the fml was trained to be a sex worker/pleasurer, for different alien üëΩ men. And so knows how to please the one that ends up being her mate. Not only that you have studied them, but you don‚Äôt expect his reaction!!!But you initially start the hanky pinky üòïRight. Right. So when it‚Äôs time for y‚Äôall to make out or do heavy petting or be intimate you freeze up and freak out like an 1600‚Äôs virgin üò®üò®üò®üò±üò±ü§Ø. Then you put the poor man who love you through hellüò£üò£üò£and the staff all join you instead of helping him properly court you?!?

Title: This is my second favourite
Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2021
Review: I knew that after reading Taken to Kor, Boone was going to match how much I loved Fork. However, I was so wrong about my assumptions because Raingar is almost as good as him.
The book had everything you would expect from this series and more. The descriptions take you away and immerse you into a universe from which you don't want to leave. Raingar's ornery ways are absolutely endearing and Essima's spunk makes their interactions hilarious. The cameos make the book even more amazing! I absolutely loved it! Can't wait for the next book!
